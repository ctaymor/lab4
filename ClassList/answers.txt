Reflections on lab:
Overall, I found this lab fairly easy but interesting. There were a few
spots where I got stuck for a while though. For a long time, all my 
calls to resources via R.layout.row, for example, or R.id.name, were not compiling.
The program was searching for those files in android.R which I had imported.
Since we were no longer using any files from that library, I removed it and it worked fine.
I am curious (and never figured out) how you would specify something from a local R file vs
the android.R file if you need to use both and need to import that library.

I also got stuck for a while with the constructor of ArrayAdaptor (well, my
extension of it). My program wasn't running, the logs said it was because of an 
IllegalStateException, and that ArrayAdapter requires the resource ID to be
a text view. I tried a bunch of different stuff, but it didn't occur to me to
check whether there was an alternate constructor which took both the layout (row.xml)
and the text view. I set it aside for a day or two and when I came back you had added the
information about the 4 argument constructor to the lab.

I do feel like I learned a lot though. It was frustrating but good to have to work on creating
our ArrayAdapter from the instructions in the Busy Coder's Guide. What I mean is, I appreciated the
challenge of having to build it myself with similar code, but not exactly the same. It meant I 
tried a whole bunch more things and made more mistakes, and then straightened them out eventually,
but I learned more doing so than with Big Nerd Ranch book's specific coding instructions. I do
feel like I've learned a lot from the Big Nerd Ranch book, but I enjoyed the greater challenge.
I especially enjoyed the challenge of such sparse lab instructions, although I didn't
finish the lab until after you had added more in-depth instructions. I learned a lot in the process
though!
